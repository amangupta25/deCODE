# Machine Learning for Earthquakes Prediction

## Objective:
Forecast the intensity, time and the, to be affected areas by observing the pre-Earthquake events data.

An earthquake is preceded by several pre-occurrence stages/phenomena:
These pre-stages include: 
- Abnormal ionic emissions
- Sudden variations in seismic shift velocities.
- Anomalies in electric and gravitational field
- Sudden groundwater level changes 

These pre-stages data can be treated as parameters into our prediction model.
Even though the efficiency of a model canâ€™t be determined beforehand without analyzing the data, still we can fall to a few models:
### 1. Logistic Regression: 
The parameters most like interact in a non-linear fashion and in such a case logistic regression approach is the best classic way.Intensity prediction might be an issue with this model as even though it's a fast model to learn its mainly effective on binary classification problems. 
### 2. Linear Discriminant Analysis: 
As the project goes on, more and more are parameters are most likely to come into the picture. When we have more than two classes then the Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm is the preferred linear classification technique.
The representation of LDA is pretty straightforward. It consists of the statistical properties of your data, calculated for each class. For a single input variable this includes:
- The mean value for each class.
- The variance calculated across all classes.

Various parameters which can be noticed with the increase in the intensity of earthquakes
- Hydrochemical precursors  
- Temperature Change  
- Water Level  
- Radon Gas 
- Oil Wells  
- Changes in Seismic Wave Velocity


## Unusual Animal Behaviour
Studying earthquakes has inherent diffculties because of its infrequent and unpredictable nature. Reports indicate that animals have unusual behaviour prior to an earthquake. Some animals have a remarkable ability of sensing things that humans cannot. Animals can sense even small changes in the environment and this changes their behaviour which when studied can often lead to inferences and predictions about earthquakes. Studying animal behaviour can help us build better sensors to detect the earthquake signals.
