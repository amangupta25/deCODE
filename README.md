# Machine-Learning in Earthquakes prediction

## Objective:
Forecast the intensity, time and the, to be affected areas by observing the pre-Earthquake events data.

An earthquake is preceded by several pre-occurrence stages/phenomena:
These pre-stages include: 
- Abnormal ionic emissions
- Sudden variations in seismic shift velocities.
- Anomalies in electric and gravitational field
- Sudden groundwater level changes
